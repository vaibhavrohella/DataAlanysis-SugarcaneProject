# DataAlanysis-SugarcaneProject
This project focuses on predicting sugarcane yield using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest. The goal is to create a reliable model that can estimate crop yield based on key agricultural features.
